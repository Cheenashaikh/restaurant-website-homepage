                    <p>I developed **Maid Genie** as part of my Techno course, with the goal of creating a platform that simplifies the process of hiring reliable and professional home assistance. Throughout this project, I aimed to combine my technical skills with a practical solution to address the growing demand for trustworthy maid services. The platform connects clients with skilled maids for various household tasks, offering a seamless user experience and ensuring quality and reliability. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of web development, user interface design, and service management, while also focusing on creating a solution that enhances everyday life for busy individuals and families..</p>
